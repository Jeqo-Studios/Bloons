# Security Policy
Reporting security concerns is important, especially with open-source projects so it's important that we report all vulnerabilities where possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not publicly report security issues, please message jeqo on discord to keep the information regarding the issue private.

The report will be reviewed as soon as possible and will be addressed appropriately.
